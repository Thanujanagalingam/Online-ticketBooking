  <h2>Important Facts About Hikkaduwa Hatchery</h2>

  <div class="p1">
      <p>
          Presently, there are five species of turtles that are taken care of in the hatchery and rescue centre. 
          Such species are the Olive Ridley Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, and Green Turtle.
          The facilities of the sea turtle hatchery and rescue centre are all state-of-the-art, complete with water tanks to 
          care for newborn turtles, along with adult turtle species that have been rescued from the sea due to injuries. One 
          of the more peculiar sights in the centre is the area in which the turtles lay their eggs, as they have distinct little 
          mounds of sand piled neatly between one another. Each of these mounds is monitored closely to calculate the hatching process 
          of the turtle eggs.

      <p>Turtles are reptiles of the order Chelonii. Therefore, they are also called chelonians by researchers and conservationists.
        Chelonians are characterized by the special bony shell or carapace, which is developed from their ribs and acts as a shield.
        They are an old group with the very first proto-turtles having evolved over 220 million years ago in the Triassic Era. The
        order of Chelonii, also known as the Testudines, has three members in the group: turtles, tortoises, and terrapins.</p>

      <p>The Hikkaduwa National Park has long been known to be one of the most kaleidoscopic attractions of the southern coast of the island.
        Boasting a myriad of coral, along with an array of marine species, the reef is a strip that allows one to understand just how diverse
        Sri Lanka is in terms of its wildlife. The marine park serves as one of the three marine national parks on the island, which extends to
        a depth of around 5 meters. While it is not known to many, the national park, especially the reef, acts as one of the major protectors of
        the Hikkaduwa Beach, as it does not allow the beach to erode.</p>
